# Computer hygiene is very important

When we use a computer, we don't realize how many processes are running in the background. When you read this on your phone or computer, there are a bunch of processes running in the background. It is worth taking care that none of these processes harm us or slow down our work

## Antivirus

Antivirus is a must. Many antiviruses have unnecessary add-ons. Included vpn, device encryption, or cleaning programs. Let's make sure that our antivirus was:

- Not cluttered with unnecessary add-ons
- Works fast, but accurately
- Trusted and neutral towards countries

## Disk

When a disk is clogged, it does not work effectively. So it is worth checking if it is not occupied more than 90% by any chance

## Startup programs

Make sure we don't have any unnecessary/unwanted processes running in the background at startup, such as:

- Game clients
- Unknown programs (not related to the system)

## Updates

Make sure our system and programs are updated. This can protect us from vulnerabilities
