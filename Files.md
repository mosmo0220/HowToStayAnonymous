# Contents of files

Every file has a ton of information contained within it, such as creation date, location, etc. This is metadata, and if you don't want to share it, it would be worth taking care of it

## Metadata modification and read

For metadata modification we can use appropriate programs such as:

- [TigoTago](http://tigotago.com/)
- [Metadata++](https://www.logipole.com/metadata++-en.htm)
