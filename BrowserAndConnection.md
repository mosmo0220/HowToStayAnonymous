# Why we should additionally encrypt our connection
Even though https encryption is common, a lot of data about us is still publicly available. With every login to Facebook, information such as where you logged in, what ip your device had, and what time you did it is collected. Companies often collect information about our exact location, and we don't pay attention to it. This should change

## Location
Hiding our physical location is not difficult. As long as we do not have a virus on our device, it is enough to simply disable location and turn it on only when we need it. However, if we need it in some applications all the time, it is worth to check which applications have access to location, including websites and web applications: [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)

## Tor browser
Is a special browser that have onion encryption and alows us to visit .onion sites: [.onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion)
In short, it makes our connection even without VPN undetectable because it goes through multiple servers at once that never connect

## VPN
Changes our location and encrypts our connection: [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)
When we choose a vpn we should check things like: log policy, bandwidth, number of servers, type of encryption, device support

### VPN vs Tor:
* VPN:
    - Faster,
    - Easier to use
    - Includes connection to the web not just in the browser
* Tor:
    - Slower
    - Allows you to connect to .onion sites
    - Includes only connection in browser

# Browser select:
Here we have few options, but rules always are the same, we must have:
- Seted fast search engine
- Blocking tracking and adverse
- A clean, untainted look

## Browser tier list:

2. Firefox: [Download](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
